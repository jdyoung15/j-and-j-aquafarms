        <img src="../assets/images/aquaponics/build-own/full/img-1.jpg" data-description="The IBC (Intermediate Bulk Container) tote can be made into a nice, starter Aquaponic system. Used totes are common in agricultural/industrial areas. (Craigslist, anyone?) In Central California they can be found for under $100. That may be because we are the bread basket of the world. Be sure to get totes that have been used to hold non toxic materials, like liquid fertilizer and food products.">
        <img src="../assets/images/aquaponics/build-own/full/img-2.jpg" data-description="First remove the two bars that hold the plastic tank into the metal frame. They are commonly a hex or torx head bolt.">
        <img src="../assets/images/aquaponics/build-own/full/img-3.jpg" data-description="Slide the tank out of the frame. You can now work on each part more easily.">
        <img src="../assets/images/aquaponics/build-own/full/img-4.jpg" data-description="Common methods of cutitng the frame are 1. Sawsall (reciprocating saw) 2. angle grinder 3. hacksaw 4. Oxy/aceltelyne torch (shown here)">        <img src="../assets/images/aquaponics/build-own/full/img-5.jpg" data-description="Depending on the method of cutting, you can now trim and smooth out the cut ends. The plastic tank can be cut with a circular saw to the same dimensions as the frame. At this point, J and JAquafarms likes to install a center drain, which requires a hole cut into the tank and frame, and securing a 1 1/2 to 2&quot; PVC fitting. This is purely a fish consideration. Center drains enable the tank to be self cleaning, as the solids get carried away by the vortex. The existing side drain can still be used to empty the tank for routine maintenance.">
        <img src="../assets/images/aquaponics/build-own/full/img-6.jpg" data-description="After placing the grow bed part of the tank into its corresponding frame, you can opt to build a grow media support to minimize &quot;dead&quot; (low oxygen) areas. Again, this is a consideration for the fish, as toxic substances and diseases grow in anoxic conditions. The rings are 3 and 4&quot; drain pipe and the mesh is poly hardware &quot;cloth&quot; comonly found at hardware stores. In the center of the tank you can see the inverted cone set into the 1&quot; pvc standpipe. This is part of the auto siphon (bell siphon) that powers the grow bed in a Flood-and-Drain aquaponic system. Auto siphons can work with a straight standpipe, but the &quot;bell&quot; often helps jumpstart stubborn siphons.">
        <img src="../assets/images/aquaponics/build-own/full/img-7.jpg" data-description="Mustard greens growing in December. This system has red lava rock grow media. See other grow media options below. Notice the white 6&quot; diameter gravel media guard, shielding the auto siphon.">
        <img src="../assets/images/aquaponics/build-own/full/img-8.jpg" data-description="The beauty of Aquaponics is its flexibility. You can tailor your system accoring to aesthetics, space, funds, and available materials. Other popular grow media are hydroton (expanded clay), expanded shale, 1&quot; granite aggregate.">
        <img src="../assets/images/aquaponics/build-own/full/img-9.jpg" data-description="Painting the exterior of the tank black or dark extends the lifespan of the polyethlene tank, especially in sunny climates.">
        <img src="../assets/images/aquaponics/build-own/full/img-10.jpg" data-description="Systems can be made compact by stacking the grow bed on the fish tank.">
        <img src="../assets/images/aquaponics/build-own/full/img-11.jpg" data-description="The ultimate space saving stack, without having to cut the frame.">
