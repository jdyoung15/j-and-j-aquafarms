In Central California they can be found for under $100. That may be because we are the bread basket of the world. Be sure to get totes that have been used to hold non toxic materials, like liquid fertilizer and food products."

          description: "Depending on the method of cutting, you can now trim and smooth out the cut ends. The plastic tank can be cut with a circular saw to the same dimensions as the frame. At this point, J and JAquafarms likes to install a center drain, which requires a hole cut into the tank and frame, and securing a 1 1/2 to 2&quot; PVC fitting. This is purely a fish consideration. Center drains enable the tank to be self cleaning, as the solids get carried away by the vortex. The existing side drain can still be used to empty the tank for routine maintenance."

          description: "After placing the grow bed part of the tank into its corresponding frame, you can opt to build a grow media support to minimize &quot;dead&quot; (low oxygen) areas. Again, this is a consideration for the fish, as toxic substances and diseases grow in anoxic conditions. The rings are 3 and 4&quot; drain pipe and the mesh is poly hardware &quot;cloth&quot; comonly found at hardware stores. In the center of the tank you can see the inverted cone set into the 1&quot; pvc standpipe. This is part of the auto siphon (bell siphon) that powers the grow bed in a Flood-and-Drain aquaponic system. Auto siphons can work with a straight standpipe, but the &quot;bell&quot; often helps jumpstart stubborn siphons."
